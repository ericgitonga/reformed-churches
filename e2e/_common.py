"""Shared helpers for the Playwright E2E smoke suite.

Written against the Python `playwright` package (the `ds` conda env already has it installed
with browsers pre-cached), not `@playwright/test` — deliberate, so Python tooling doesn't need
a parallel npm toolchain. Specs are plain scripts (`TESTS = [...]` list of functions,
`assert`-based), run via:

    npm run build && npm start   # in one terminal
    conda run -n ds python e2e/run.py   # in another

BASE_URL overrides the default local server; CI points it at a locally built-and-started server
(see .github/workflows/e2e.yml) rather than a live Vercel Preview URL, to avoid depending on
Vercel's own deployment-webhook timing.
